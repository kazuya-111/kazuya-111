## ⚠️ Note on Completion
This assignment is **partially incomplete**.  
While some features are not fully functional, the focus of the assessment was to demonstrate understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** such as encapsulation, inheritance, aggregation, and composition.  

### Implemented:
- Private attributes with getters/setters and validation
- Aggregation and composition relationships
- Inheritance structure following the UML diagram
- Basic testing and documentation

### Not Fully Implemented:
- Complete program execution flow
- Some interactive features

### Future Improvements:
- Fix incomplete methods to ensure full functionality
- Add more robust testing
- Extend features beyond the original assignment scope
