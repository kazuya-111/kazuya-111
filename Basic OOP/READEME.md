# COMP1046 â€“ Object Oriented Programming  
## Assignment 1: Basic Programming (Weighting: 20%)

### ðŸ“Œ Overview
This assignment focuses on applying **fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** in Python.  
Students are required to design and implement classes that demonstrate encapsulation, aggregation, composition, and inheritance, while following a provided UML diagram and supplemental instructions.

---

### ðŸ§© Key Requirements
- **Attributes and Encapsulation**  
  - Define private attributes.  
  - Provide getters and setters with validation logic.  

- **Aggregation**  
  - Implement relationships where one class contains references to other objects.  
  - Provide `add` and `get` methods to manage these relationships.  

- **Composition**  
  - Correctly create and use composition (objects that cannot exist independently of the parent).  

- **Inheritance**  
  - Apply inheritance to reuse code and demonstrate polymorphism where appropriate.  

- **Other Requirements**  
  - Follow the UML diagram and supplemental instructions provided.  

---

### ðŸ§ª Testing
- Each method must be sufficiently tested.  
- Results should be displayed clearly to verify correctness.  

---

### ðŸ“š Documentation
- All classes and methods must include **brief doc comments** explaining their purpose.  

---

### ðŸ”§ Version Control
- At least **10 Git commits** with meaningful commit messages are required.  
- The `.git` folder should be included to demonstrate version history.  

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
- Apply **OOP principles** (encapsulation, aggregation, composition, inheritance).  
- Strengthen skills in **class design, validation, and code reuse**.  
- Gain experience in **testing, documentation, and version control best practices**.
