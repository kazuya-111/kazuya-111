# Assignment 2 – Python Programming

This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 2** of the PSP course.  
The assignment is divided into two main parts:

1. **Part I: List Manipulation Module** – Implementing a Python module with list manipulation functions.
2. **Part II: Simple Social Network Manager** – Managing personal profile information using object-oriented programming and file I/O.

---

## 🧩 Part I: List Manipulation Module
- Implemented a Python module (`list_function.py`) containing functions to manipulate lists.
- Functions include:
  - Adding elements
  - Removing elements
  - Searching within lists
  - Updating values
- A test file (`assign2_partI_test_file.py`) is provided to validate the functions.
- Focus: **modular programming, function design, and testing**.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Part II: Simple Social Network Manager
- Developed a program (`social.py`) to manage a simple social network.
- Uses a `Profile` class (`profile.py`) to represent personal profile information.
- Profile data is stored in a text file (`profiles.txt`) and loaded at program start.
- Features:
  - **summary** – display all profiles
  - **add** – add a new profile
  - **remove** – delete a profile
  - **search** – find a profile
  - **update** – modify profile details
  - **quit** – exit the program
- Focus: **object-oriented programming, file handling, and interactive command-line interfaces**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- File I/O (`open`, `read`, `write`)
- List operations
