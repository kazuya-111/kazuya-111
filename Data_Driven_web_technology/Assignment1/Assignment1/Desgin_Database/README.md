# INFS 1025 ‚Äì Data Driven Web Technologies  
## Assignment 1 (Weighting: 20%)

### üìå Overview
This assignment is to be completed **individually**.  
It focuses on designing and implementing a relational database system for hospital data, based on datasets from Massachusetts General Hospital.  

The goal is to merge multiple datasets (patients, procedures, encounters, payers) into a consistent database design that supports future scalability (e.g., additional hospitals).  

Original datasets and descriptions are available from Maven Analytics:

### üè• Background
- Current data is stored in multiple Excel spreadsheets.  
- The aim is to design a database that reduces anomalies, supports queries, and can later be integrated into a website for verified users.  
- Data includes:
  - Patient data  
  - Procedures  
  - Encounters  
  - Payers (e.g., Medicare)

### üìù Tasks

#### **Task 1: Domain Model Diagram**
- Identify all relevant keys (including candidate keys).  
- Define appropriate relationships and multiplicities.  
- Ensure design meets **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**.  
- Provide justification for design decisions (8 bullet points).  
- Show one example of normalization from an Excel spreadsheet.  

#### **Task 2: Table Schemas**
- Translate the domain model into **8 table schemas**.  
- Clearly identify all relevant keys.  

#### **Task 3: Table Creation Statements**
- Write SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements for all 8 tables.  
- Use appropriate data types and sizes.  
- Follow naming conventions and constraints as discussed in class.  

#### **Task 4: Data Population**
- Provide example SQL queries to extract data from Excel and populate the new tables.  
- Include at least 3 tables with `INSERT` and `UPDATE` examples.  
- Reference:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- This is an **individual assignment**.  
- Do not discuss with peers; multiple design options exist.  
- Extensions require valid documentation.  
- **Use of Generative AI tools is strictly prohibited**. Work must reflect your own understanding and analysis.
